\f0\fs24 \cf0 iFixLoop\
by ShadowSonic2\
\
iFixLoop is a one-click script that will allow iDevice Owners to get out of a\
recovery boot-loop. Instead of manually inputting the commands in iRecovery,\
iFixLoop does it for you.\
\
\
\
======Usage=======\
1. Turn off 'looped' device and unplug it from USB port.\
2. Hold home on your device and continue to hold it as you plug it back into your\
Mac, keep holding home until the Recovery Logo comes up.\
3. Run the iFixLoop.app\
4. Wait for your device to reboot.\
5. Device doesn't get passed the recovery screen but boot-loop is gone :)\
\
\
=====Notes======\
1. Thanks to the author(s) of iRecovery. It was needed to make this app.\
